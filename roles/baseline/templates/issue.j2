Alright, ye bilge rats! Shorter orders from the Cap'n regarding this here Server Flagship:

AVAST YE!

Ye be treadin' on the Cap'n's own Server Flagship! 
No trespassin' on these digital decks without the Cap'n's express leave (that means proper credentials, savvy?).
Tamperin' with the ship's systems or pilferin' data is an act o' high digital piracy!

The First Mate o' the Mainframe's spyglass be fixed on this server! 
Every command ye breathe, every connection ye forge, is monitored and logged in the Ship's Datastream Ledger,
tighter than a miser's grip on gold.

Any digital mutineers or data thieves will face the Cap'n's swift justice: 
connections keelhauled, IPs blacklisted from these seas, 
and access permanently revoked!

Consider yerselves warned! ☠️
